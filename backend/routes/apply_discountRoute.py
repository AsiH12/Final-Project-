# Applies discounts to a shopping cart based on the provided discount codes.

# Parameters:
    # cart (list): A list of dictionaries representing the items in the cart. Each dictionary should have the following keys: 'product_id', 'name', 'image', 'amount'.
    # used_discounts (list): A list of discount codes that have already been applied to the cart.
    # new_discount_code (str): A new discount code to apply to the cart.

# Returns:
    # dict: A dictionary containing the discounted cart items, original total price, and discounted total price.

# Raises:
    # ValueError: If any discount code is not valid or has expired, or if the new discount code doesn't affect the cart.
    # Exception: If any other error occurs during the process.
